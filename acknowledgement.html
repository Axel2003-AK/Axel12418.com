                    <p>
                        I am deeply grateful to everyone who contributed to the creation of this book, “The Dawns and The Dusks.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I owe immense gratitude to Sir Kelly Foundation for the words of encouragement shared across their forums especially “We Have a Dream” and “Never Say Die” which is a source of my motivation.
                        </p>
