                According to Oxford Languages who are the world largest dictionary publishers, DAWN is defined in two ways, the first as, “the first appearance of light in the sky before sunrise” and the second as, “the beginning of a phenomenon or period of time, especially one considered favorable.”

                <P>
                On the other hand, Merriam Webster defines DUSK as being “darkness or semidarkness caused by the shutting out of light”. The title of this book made up of the two words and the definitions of the two words. THE DAWN stands for the happy & good moments in life while THE DUSK stands for the sad and bad moments in life. THE DAWN will mainly simplify the favorable periods of time in life when there is light one our path while THE DUSK will simplify the unfavorable periods of time in life when it is deem, gloomy and dark. 
                The two words shall define life in different ways using different examples and in the end we are going to find out that life is double-edged.
