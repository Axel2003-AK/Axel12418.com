                Life isn't a pre-determined script; it's an open book waiting to be authored which once authored shouldn’t be solely judged by its exterior. A little glimpse into someone's day doesn't reveal the entirety of their narrative. As the Kalenjin proverb wisely states,<b><i> "Mesas kapchi komeru"</i></b> (Never judge a home until you've slept there), so too should we avoid hasty evaluations of someone's life journey but should reserve judgment until you have truly walked in someone’s shoes.

                This book unfolds in chapters made up of pages having each page a unique experience. Paragraphs flow from sentences, sentences from words, and words from the fundamental building blocks of language. Likewise, our lives are constructed from a multitude of moments, both grand and insignificant. Even the most intricate scientific analysis can't fully predict the unpredictable twists and turns that will come our way. Change is life's constant companion which is ever inevitable.

                Life is made up of several pages which forms the chapters which contribute to its grand narrative. Some chapters brims with joy as goals previously set are achieved while others may be laced with disappointment due to the unachieved or unsatisfying results. To create fulfilling pages adding up to chapters contributing to the grand narrative, thoughtful composition of it all is key. A well written chapter today increases the likelihood of a positive tomorrow made up of expected and non-predetermined triumphs.

                Embrace the role of author and play it yourself. Never succumb to external pressures as their consequences shall be faced by you and might be a reason someone else will be laughing at you. Pick what all and sundry are saying while practicing “say less and listen more”. Discern advice, incorporate what resonates, and craft your own narrative. If a chapter is doesn’t give you any reason to smile, close it and start a new one. Ultimately, the satisfaction of a self-authored life resonates deeply which a story worth revisiting time and again in the present and even in the days to come.

                Reflection is a valuable tool. Revisit past chapters as you identify the similarities and differences between them and the present. Identify the patterns, the triumphs and missteps that shaped your journey. These lessons serve as guideposts, giving you opportunities and ways to navigate the current chapter and avoid repetition of past errors. However, dwelling excessively on prior chapters can impede progress. As the saying goes, don't get so lost in yesterday that you miss out on today and do not dwell so much on the previous chapters as you may not begin a new one.

                Every page of every book differs in one way or another. The first one will have a different font size and type from the last one. The page layout for the second one may be different from that of the third one. One will have more paragraphs than the other which is a similar case to life. Life has diverse experiences, perspectives and emotions and therefore it is vital to embrace this diversity of life. In putting down this diverse narrative keep in mind the differences to avoid the disappointment of changes from one experience t o the other and one perception to the other.
