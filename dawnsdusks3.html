                    <p><b>LIFE IS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CHOICES WE MAKE AND THOSE WE MADE.</b> 
                        <p>
                            Our lives are shaped by the choices we make, both in the past and in the present. The decisions we make, the parts we take, ultimately determine the life we are going to lead. We can choose to emulate those we admire, practicing their positive traits and potentially leading a life we and others admire. Conversely, following a flawed example can lead us down a path paved with consequences we never intended.

                            Consider a tale of two brothers and their father. The two sons idolized their father who was chained to the bottle. He was addicted to the point that every penny he earned went into purchase of alcoholic drinks. The use of drugs beyond recommendations made him hostile to those near and dear to him. This made him not to play his vital role of being the head of the family and being a father to his two sons who looked upon him.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            One of the sons, tragically misinterpreting his father’s “relaxation,” embraced drugs with a lot of fervor that posed a threat to his wellbeing.  Food became less important than the drugs and therefore he had to satisfy his thirst for the bottle before thinking of satisfying his hunger. He had no job and therefore to get some capital to make purchases of his drinks, he borrowed, stole or even pawned his family’s possessions. His health crumbled, his mind dulled, all in a desperate pursuit of a warped version of his father’s source of “relaxation”. When he was asked the reason behind his choice of the deadly path, his answer was that because he wanted to be like his father. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The other son, however, saw his father’s path as a cautionary tale. He let all his energy into studies, a relentless pursuit that propelled him from primary school, through high school to the university, graduating with top honors. His dedication landed him the coveted job of his dreams. Unlike his brother, his laughter resonated with genuine joy, a reward for his hard work and integrity. When asked about the motivation behind his choice, his response was that he refused to be his father, instead striving to be a better son, brother, leader, and ultimately, the best version of himself he could be. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The choices of these brothers illustrate the profound impact our decisions have on our lives. While one son's emulation of his father led to ruin, the other’s rejection of that path yielded prosperity. Each bore the consequences of their decisions, reaping what they sowed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            In the end, while influence may guide our choices, it does not dictate our destiny. Both sons faced the same upbringing but chose divergent paths, leading to vastly different outcomes. Their lives serve as a reminder that while influence may shape us, our choices define us.

                            <p>I can't bring this chapter to a close without including a poem by <b>LANGSTON HUGHES</b> which is an advice by a mother to her son but since a mother is a parent a father who is parent too can also make use of the poem to advice his sons or daughters:</p>
