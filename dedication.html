        <h2>DEDICATION</h2>
            <b><p>
            This book is dedicated to <u>ALL the DREAMERS</u>> in <u>SIR KELLY FOUNDATION</u> who never say “NEVER” but fight till the change they have been anticipating changes.  
            </p>
            <p>
            It is dedicated to <u>Kipsigis Girls High School</u> where I found some time to put it all on paper. From the leadership of the school who play a vital role in ensuring the day to day activities of the school run smoothly, to the teachers undertaking the Nobel profession of molding the future of the globe without forgetting the support staff and mostly the students who go through the ups and downs of daily school life and the bitter roots of education while keeping in mind the sweet fruits ahead of them. 
            </p>
            <p>
            It is also dedicated to every person out there grinding day in day out, feeling the hardness and the softness of life. Those waking up and making hay from the time the sun starts burning to the time the sets.
