            <h1>DISCLAIMER</h1>
<p>
This book is a personal idea of the author. The title and all the ideas found in the book and are similar to any other in other books are just but confidence.
</p>
<p>
The book is not yet full with almost half of its chapters and the other chapters are yet to be added. Also some parts of the book such as the reference part and the glossary among others are yet to be uploaded and it has not been proofread yet and therefore all errors are yet to be corrected. The book has just been uploaded online as a project of the author to test self on website development.
