            <b>Life is a JOURNEY TRAVEL CAUTIOSLY</b>
            <p>
                Life is a journey, a long walk with many twists and turns beginning with a single stride and stretches across countless miles as the saying goes: a journey of thousands miles begins with one step forward. It starts from mere centimeters to vast kilometers, a path that can start from being a small leak to greatest achievements and the vice versa is true.

                The beginning of every journey may provide you with a hint on what shall come next. However, things may take a different turn along the way. Adequate preparation significantly enhances the likelihood of success coming your way while hasty planning invites errors that might create a hard to climb huddle a head of you altering your progress. Taking time to gather the necessities of the journey shall give you a smooth adventure. But throw some stuff in the last minute, and you might be missing essentials once you get there.

                The same goes for life. Approaching it with foresight ensures one doesn't run out of essential resources midway, akin to the parable of the wise and foolish virgins in the Bible. The wise virgins took extra oil for their lamps while the foolish ones didn’t. At midnight the cry rang out indicating the arrival of the bridegroom. The wise ones used their extra oil to light their lamps while the foolish ones had already ran out of their oil. They requested the wise ones to give them some oil but they were not given. The wise ones told them the oil wasn’t enough for all of them and directed them to go and purchase at the store. The foolish ones went out to buy the oil and while they were gone, the bridegroom arrived and the wise ones met him then had a feast and the door was closed. When the foolish ones arrived, they asked the bridegroom to let them in but the bridegroom told them that he didn’t know them (Mathew 25: 1- 13). The wise ones’ adequate preparedness paid off for them while the foolish ones’ failure to plan adequately also paid off but not in their favor.

                Take school, for example. Starting strong with quality grades sets you up for success. Getting quality grades in your first year is not only a stepping stone but also a motivation for you to keep up and this is all about building great foundations in all your subjects by keeping very good relations with your instructors (teachers) and books. Quality grades hardly go unrewarded whether in school, outside school or even at home. These rewards reinforce the behavior of getting the grades which pushes you to work hard in order to maintain it. One student at Kericho High School nailed this. In his first examination, he got the most quality grade which became a solid foundation which enabled him get the same most quality grade at the end of his four year course.

                A solid foundation can withstand life’s challenges- the ups and downs, the temptations, and the tough times. This journey is like a rocket blasting off. Just as a rocket sheds its boosters after reaching the orbit, so too will your journey see companions come and go. People will come into your life and go, some of them will go when you are ready to walk alone while others will depart unexpectedly, leaving a void. It is a bittersweet reality of life just like the shedding of leaves by trees during autumn.
