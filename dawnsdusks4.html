                        <b>LIFE IS LIKE A GAME.</b> Have you ever thought about life this way? Have you ever tried to find meaning in life? How did you do that? Did you use a metaphor to describe life, or something else? If you used a metaphor, what was it and why did you choose it? Something in life drives you forward, whether expected or unexpected. Whether you've used a metaphor or not, keep reading and you might start seeing life as a game by the time you finish this chapter.

                        Every game worldwide involves competition. Think of athletics, held annually in different countries. People talk about who won gold, silver, or bronze medals. Even before teams compete, leaders promise rewards and citizens wish them luck. During events, whether you're in the stadium or at home, everyone cheers for their athletes. Winners are celebrated with rewards and their country's flag raised high. Social media explodes with congratulations. Back home, they're rewarded again.

                        In football, like the English Premier League, teams like Arsenal and Manchester United have fans globally. When they clash, fans worldwide watch, cheering their team winners delight fans, while losers' fans feel disappointed, some leave matches early. Even other teams' fans criticize losers, adding to their misery.

                        In these examples, words like "winning" and "losing" stand out. Winners are rewarded handsomely by organizers and fans alike. Losers face judgment, even from those not supporting the winners.

                        In life, when you achieve something remarkable, everyone praises you. Positive messages flood in, and strangers share your success on social media. They're happy for you, though unaware of your struggles or sacrifices. However, life also brings judgment if you disappoint. Even if you did your best, failing to win leaves you open to criticism.

                        <p>Just like in any game with rules, life has boundaries. Like football's yellow and red cards, life has its limits. Eating has guidelinesâ€”too much or too little affects health. Neglecting dental care leads to problems. Life, like any game, rewards those who follow the rules and punishes those who don't.</p>
                        <p>
                        Life, ultimately, is a game we all play, where success and failure shape our experiences.
